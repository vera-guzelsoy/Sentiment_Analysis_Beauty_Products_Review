# Sentiment Analysis on Beauty Products using NLP

## Introduction
The company wants to develop a software tool that will identify the positive and negative words which customers use when they write reviews for the beauty products as their purchase inclination. For that, they gave their 9 years beauty products’ reviews between 2005-2014 and asked us to develop a model which will identify positive and negative words used in the reviews as a component of customer’s sentiment towards to the company’s beauty products.
