# Sentiment Analysis on Beauty Products using NLP

## Introduction
The company wants to develop a software tool that will identify the positive and negative words which customers use when they write reviews for the beauty products as their purchase inclination. For that, they gave their 9 years beauty products’ reviews between 2005-2014 and asked us to develop a model which will identify positive and negative words used in the reviews as a component of customer’s sentiment towards to the company’s beauty products.

## Data

The data is in Standford Analysis Project (SNAP) webpage. The original data was in a JSON format there. In order to analyze the data, I imported JSON package and decoded JSON file with using query in order to convert JSON file to csv file format. The original dataset for this project can be found [here](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/reviews_Beauty_10.json.gz)
